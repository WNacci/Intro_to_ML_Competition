# ML Competition!

# New Feature Ideas
- Absolute distance between ADP and somas
- Soma to soma total path length
- Implement deep model predictive value on feature weights
- Kernel PCA?
- PCA with just feature weights and embeddings
- 3D (and multi-dim) PCA

# General Notes
- Stratified Bootstrapping

# ToDo
- [ ] Implement a searching validation set to better tune hyperparameters
- [ ] Try training ensemble models with PCA, see performance changes

# Feature Engineering Ideas
- Better functionality association
    - (Embedding similarity/correlation)
    - I think this could be very effective

# XGboost
- Reconstruct data to fit XGboost (categorical data.. etc?)
