# ML Competition!

# New Feature Ideas
- Absolute distance between ADP and somas
- Soma to soma total path length
- Implement deep model predictive value on feature weights
- Kernel PCA?
- PCA with just feature weights and embeddings
- 3D (and multi-dim) PCA

# General Notes
- Stratified Bootstrapping

# ToDo
- [ ] Setup testing pipeline
    - [ ] Setup file for data input & initial assembly
    - [ ] Setup file for data processing
    - [ ] Setup file for data splitting & testing
- [ ] Get Random Forest working
    - Lab 19
    - Genevera Said that very engineered features may not work well with RF?
- [ ] Try Boosting
    - Lab 20..?
